## My process:

### Built with:

- HTML5, CSS3 and SCSS/SASS
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned:

Recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project:

#### General things I've learned:

- Review of HTML & CSS (Almost forgotten some syntax)
- CSS Flex Layout
- Make more use of css variables to make the code more readable & clean
- Make use of dynamic class that has same style to avoid redundancy
- Use less class and keep HTML Structure simple as possible
