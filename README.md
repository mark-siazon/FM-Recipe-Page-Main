### The challenge:

Users should be able to:

## My process:

### Built with:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned:

Recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project:

#### General things I've learned:

- Basic review of HTML & CSS
- CSS Flex Layout (I'm comfortable utilzing it)
  - Finished it much faster than older projects using flex + few adjustment in spacing
- Make more use of css variables to make the code more readable & clean
- Make use of dynamic class that has same style to avoid redundancy

#### New things I've found/learned better:

- Reconsider using pixels (px) in size that doesn't need much adjustment.
- Avoid overusing of vh & vw, as it can cause problems in other devices.
